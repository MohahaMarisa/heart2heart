# heart2heart iOS App

It's your phone as a beating heart that you can hold in your hand. 
The phone has haptics that pulses in time with the desired heartbeat detected through the camera lighting up a pointer finger.
In this case, it's the heart beat of the user you specify already on the network. Currently just a prototype experiment that works over local and shared network.

Node server ("node chat-server.js" is the command) in terminal

iOS app needs to be modified to target the IP address of the computer running the node server
